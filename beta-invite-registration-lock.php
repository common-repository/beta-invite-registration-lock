Plugin Name:  Beta Invite Registration Lock
Plugin URI:   http://www.electriceasel.com/birl
Description:  This plugin will lock down the registration page for your blog, and require a user to enter a passkey in order to view the registration page. It adds another layer in front of the registration process to help secure your site. There is an administration section to the plugin to manage and view the current and used passkeys, and re-enable them if you so choose. You can also bulk generate thousands of passkeys.
